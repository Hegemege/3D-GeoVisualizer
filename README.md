# 3D-GeoVisualizer

To run the application, you must host the files on a server due to same-origin policy. If you have python installed, run the following in a directory with the files
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
or for python3+
```
python3 -m http.server
```
Finally navigate to (copy-paste to address bar)
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/index.html
``` 
on a browser that has WebGL-functionality.

This application was developed as a part of my Bachelor's thesis in Aalto University School of Science.
